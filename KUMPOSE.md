When you use kompose to convert a Docker Compose file into Kubernetes configurations, it typically creates two types of files for each service: a Deployment file and a Service file. This is because Kubernetes treats the deployment of containers and the networking aspects as separate concerns, each managed by different kinds of resources. Here’s an overview of what each file represents:

**Deployment File**

The Deployment file (database-deployment.yaml in your case) defines how your application runs in Kubernetes. It includes:

`Pod Configuration`: Defines the containers and their settings (like Docker image, ports, environment variables, etc.) that make up your application. In Kubernetes, containers run inside a Pod, which is the smallest deployable unit.

`Replicas`: Specifies how many instances of your Pod should be running. Kubernetes will attempt to maintain this number of replicas at all times.

`Update Strategy`: Controls how updates to the deployment are rolled out (like rolling updates).

`Resource Requests and Limits`: You can specify how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs and the maximum resources it can use.

**Service File**

The Service file (`database-service.yaml`) defines how to access the application (like a database or web server) running in the Pods. It includes:

`Service Type`: Determines how the service is exposed (like ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer). ClusterIP exposes the service on an internal IP in the cluster, NodePort exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port, and LoadBalancer exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

`Selector`: Connects the Service to the Pods. The Service routes traffic to Pods with matching labels.

`Ports`: Maps the port on the Service to a port on the target Pod.
